pyMOLE: Python Mimetic Operators Library Enhanced
========================================


Description
--------------

pyMOLE is a partial python port of [MOLE](https://github.com/jcorbino/mole) library
that implements high-order mimetic operators to solve partial differential equations.
It provides discrete analogs of the most common vector calculus operators:
Gradient, Divergence, Laplacian and Curl. These operators (sparse matrices) act
on staggered grids (both uniform and nonuniform) and satisfy local and
global conservation laws.

The mathematics is based on the work of
[Corbino and Castillo 2017](https://doi.org/10.4172/2168-9679.1000387).
However the user may find useful previous publications such as
[Castillo and Grone 2003](https://doi.org/10.1137/S0895479801398025),
in which similar operators are derived using a matrix analysis approach.
